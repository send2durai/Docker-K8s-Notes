Here are the instructions that we follow, inorder to create docker swarm cluster:-

1) Have an AWS account (free tier -1 year students account)
2) Go to EC2 service, spinup minimum 2-3 instances with similar spec
Example, in my case am creating 3 EC2 instances with spec of t2.micro (will get 1vCPU/1Gig Mem)
3) Post creations of EC2 instances, login them using ssh
$ ssh ec2-user@public-ip or public-dns
4) Install required plugin and settings to be install Docker on these instances. Following commands will be get executed on each systems. 
If not use bootstrap scripts, while these provisioning time itself.


    1  sudo yum update -y
    2  sudo yum install docker -y
    3  sudo systemctl start docker
    4  sudo systemctl enable docker
    5  sudo docker version

# To avoid permission issue for 'ec2-user' what we are going to do is, just adding it to the docker/wheel groups in Linux OS
    6  sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
    7  sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user
    8  sudo usermod -aG wheel ec2-user
    9 docker version

# To install Docker Swarm, you need to decide which EC2 instance will be electing as Master node.
    10. Once you decided, login to the node that you wanted to be keep as Master node
    11. $ ssh ec2-user@public-ip
    12. $ docker swarm init

# To add any worker node to this Swarm, run the following command:
docker swarm join --token xyz...................33u6c:172.31.4.6:2377

# Then we need to copy the token and it to be executed in all worker nodes..

# docker node ls   //list docker swarm cluster details
